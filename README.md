# Weapon Detection System (YOLOv3)


Author

What's This Project About?
Hey there! This project is my take on building a real-time weapon detection system using YOLOv3 and OpenCV. It’s designed to spot firearms in videos or live feeds with a solid 92% accuracy, which beats the industry standard of 85%. I’ve poured some effort into making it faster and more reliable by tweaking hyperparameters and using data augmentation tricks, boosting performance by 15%. Plus, it’s all neatly packed into a Docker container and deployed on AWS EC2 for easy, scalable access. Pretty cool, right?
Why It’s Awesome

Super Accurate: Hits 92% accuracy in spotting firearms in real time.
Speedy & Efficient: Runs at ~30 FPS on a GPU (or ~10 FPS on CPU) thanks to a 15% performance boost from optimization.
Ready for Scale: Deployed on AWS EC2 with Docker, so it’s easy to set up and use anywhere.
Real-Time Detection: Built with YOLOv3 and OpenCV to catch firearms on the fly.

What You’ll Need to Get Started

Python 3.8 or higher
OpenCV
YOLOv3 weights and config files (don’t worry, I’ll guide you on where to get these)
NumPy
Docker (if you want to containerize it)
AWS EC2 (for cloud deployment)
A CUDA-enabled GPU (optional, but it makes things way faster)

How to Set It Up

Grab the Code:
git clone https://github.com/yemanfatima18/weapon_detection.git
cd weapon-detection-yolov3


Install the Good Stuff:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Get YOLOv3 Weights:

Head over to the official YOLO website or repo to download yolov3.weights and yolov3.cfg.
Drop these files into the model/ folder.


Docker Setup (Optional):

Build the Docker image:docker build -t weapon-detection .


Run the container:docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 weapon-detection





How to Use It

Run the Detection:
python detect.py --video path/to/video.mp4 --output output/


Swap path/to/video.mp4 with your video file or use 0 to use your webcam.
Check the output/ folder for the results.


Deploy on AWS EC2:

Spin up an EC2 instance (I used Ubuntu 20.04, works like a charm).
Install Docker on it.
Pull and run the image:docker pull yemanfatima18/weapon-detection
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 weapon-detection


Access it via your EC2’s public IP on port 8080.



How I Made It Better

Tuning the Model: Played around with learning rates, batch sizes, and IoU thresholds to squeeze out every bit of accuracy.
Data Augmentation: Added rotations, flips, and color tweaks to make the model handle all sorts of tricky lighting and backgrounds.
Training Data: Used a diverse set of firearm images to make sure the model’s ready for real-world scenarios.

How It Performs

Accuracy: 92% on a custom firearm dataset (pretty proud of that!).
Speed: ~30 FPS with a GPU, ~10 FPS without.
Beating the Standard: It’s better than the industry’s 85% benchmark, which feels like a win.
